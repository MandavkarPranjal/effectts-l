title: Hello World with Effectts
description: Every programmers first line of code. Let's f*cking write it with Effectts!
---

before I start learning [Effect](https://effect.website), I was told that effect is not a framework, it is a language *(yeah it is)*.

### Core mental model (before coding)
- Effect programs are **Describing program**, not executing them immediately
- **Explicit effects** instead of hidden side effects
- **Type error channel**
- **Dependency injection via Context**

Here is a basic program that prints "Hello, world!"

```ts tab="ts"
console.log("Hello, world!")
```

```ts tab="effect"
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"; // [!code highlight]

const program = Console.log("Hello, world!")

Effect.runSync(program);
````
